        <p>Every day for the past twelve years, I have been enveloped by the joy of being part of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine community.  That joy stems from the high purpose of our instructional, research, and service missions, and the dedication and enabling support our 
          
          faculty, staff, students, alumni, trustees, and friends bring to their fulfillment.  No words can adequately express my pride in a community that eleven years ago—through a bold strategic planning process—began to foresee its future, and which has brought that future to reality.  Today, PCOM is in a much stronger position—academically, physically, and financially.  We are a multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural, multi-campus, multi-accredited institution that holds a steadfast commitment to meaningful education and experience, to accountability, to transparency, and to vision.  Moreover, the climate of collegiality, camaraderie, and mutual respect in which our work is accomplished is an inspiration.  How privileged I am to walk life&rsquo;s journey with all of you!</p>
        <p>Because we have accomplished so much together, and the College has proven its efficacy, now is an appropriate time to effect a natural transition in PCOM&rsquo;s administration.  Accordingly, I have shared with the PCOM Board of Trustees my intention to retire as President and Chief Executive Officer effective June 30, 2014.  The Board has, with extraordinary kindness, accepted my retirement decision and desire to spend more time with my family.</p>
        <p>During the next 18 months, I look forward to working closely with you to achieve and fulfill many PCOM milestones, including the successful conclusion of our forthcoming Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education and Middle States accreditations.  And during this period, I have every expectation that the PCOM Board of Trustees—a board that has shown immeasurable vision, wisdom, and commitment—will guide the College community through a search process that will culminate in the selection of an outstanding president to lead PCOM in the years to come.</p>
      <p>To all of you who contribute daily to the Mission of our College, I am humbled as I offer my profound thanks.  My years spent at PCOM have been more rewarding and fulfilling than I ever could have imagined.  The same will certainly be true of our next 18 months.</p>
